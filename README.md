UPDATE (08/10/2016): Since the Facebook Graph API has changed slightly,
an important feature of fetching a user's news feed post has been deprecated,
therefore this game cannot be played anymore unfortunately.

(Re: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v2.7/user/home)

Facebook game made in Hack The North 2014.
Two players are needed to play a game (or you could just open the application in two windows and play with yourself. That's cool too.)
and they try to guess the author of the post for each round of the game. Whoever guesses the most wins the game!
